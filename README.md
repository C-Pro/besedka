# Besedka

Besedka is a self-hosted chat application for a limited number of users (e.g. for a family or a small group of friends) built with Go and vanilla web technologies.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

**Note:** This project is currently under active development with heavy use of AI (Google Antigravity). Currently it is not functional (most of the features are hardcoded stubs).

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Go (Golang)
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Protocol**: WebSockets for real-time events

## Getting Started

To run the application locally:

1. Ensure you have Go installed (1.25+).
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

## Future Roadmap
